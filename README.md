# RX-MORSECODE - Morse Code Decoder with Angular and Reactive Extensions

This is a small project to learn the basic operators of rx.
There is also a tiny presentation available [here](http://slides.com/michael_hladky/rx-and-ng).

- code in decode.controller.js
- cheat with decode.controller_v1.js
- use code of decode.controller_v0.js to reset your work
- see final (reduced) code in decode.controller_fin.js

If you are brave you can try to solve the [extra challenge](https://github.com/BioPhoton/rx_morsecode/blob/master/app/components/decode/decode.controller.js#L122).
