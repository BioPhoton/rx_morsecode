# RX-MORSECODE - Morse Code Decoder with Angular and Reactive Extensions

This is a small project to learn the basic operators of rx.
There is also a presentation available (here)[http://slides.com/michael_hladky/rx-and-ng]

- code in decode.controller.js
- cheat with decode.controller_v1.js
- use code of decode.controller_v0.js to reset your work
- see final (reduced) code in decode.controller_fin.js

If you are brave you can try to solve the extra challenge listed at the bottom of the controller.
